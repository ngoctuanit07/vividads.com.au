            <p><strong><span class="subheading">Transacting in Multiple Currencies</span></strong><br /> <br /> PayPal has launched Multiple Currencies to facilitate payments among our diverse base of international members. PayPal is pleased to offer conversion rates that are competitive with those of other consumer services.<br /> <br /> The most readily available information on currency exchange rates is based on "interbank exchange rates". Interbank exchange rates are established in the course of currency trading among a global network of over 1,000 banks, and are not available through consumer or retail channels. Consumers may use these rates as a reference, but should not expect to use interbank rates in transactions that involve currency conversion. To obtain actual retail rates, contact your local financial institution or currency exchange, or check the rate displayed in your PayPal transaction.<br /> <br /> <span class="subheading">Displaying Conversion Rates </span><br /> <br /> PayPal will always provide information on transactions that include a currency conversion. The currency conversion rate will be displayed each time you:<br /> &nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Send a payment in a non-local currency</li>
