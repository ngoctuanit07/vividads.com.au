							Introduction</b>&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							The following artwork specifications and guidelines 
                            are to help ensure that we receive the highest 
                            quality artwork. This will enable us to produce the 
                            best quality graphic output. Please read these 
                            specifications closely and if you have any questions 
                            please do not hesitate to call.</font><br>

							<b>Supported File Types</b></font></p>
							<p>
							<font face=""Raleway",sans-serif" color="#636363" size="2">We 
							prefer to receive high resolution files in PDF 
							format.&nbsp; PDF files are smaller in size and 
							quick to upload to our uploder.<br>

							* Adobe Photoshop - Version Creative Suite 2 (CS2) 
							or earlier (.tif, .eps)&nbsp;and pdf<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							* Adobe Illustrator - Version Creative Suite 2 (CS2)

							<b>File Preparation Instructions</b>&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							* All graphic files must be built at minimum 150 dpi at the 
							final graphic print size.&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							* All graphic files must be created using CMYK mode 
							to ensure the best color matching.&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							* It is best to flatten all images and outline all 
							text to ensure that nothing will drop out or change 
							during file transfer.&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							* When submitting the files for one consistent 
							layout over two or more panels, be sure to create 
							the file as one image. DO NOT SEPARATE each panel 
							into its own separate file.&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							You need to ensure all supporting images, files and 
							fonts are included. A minimum resolution of 150dpi (CMYK 
							colour) at the full printed size is required (1:1 
							scale). We recommend you supply us images in the 
							highest resolution possible as this will provide the 
							best quality result for your banner.&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Note: Photoshop files/scans/images should be 600 dpi 
							at Â¼ of the size. This will avoid any pixilation of 
							the image due to low-resolution. <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							<b>TEXT</b>&nbsp;<br>
							Where possible ALL text should be converted to 
							outlines/paths/curves in your design software thus 
							preventing your font inadvertently being replaced 
							with a similar one. &nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							<b>FONTS</b>&nbsp;<br>
							Attach all relevant fonts including those used in 
							supporting imported or placed files. Please note 
							that Mac fonts usually comprise a printer font and a 
							screen font - we require both of these.</font></font></p>
							<p>
							<font face=""Raleway",sans-serif" color="#636363" size="2"><b>
							BLEED&nbsp;</b></font></p>
							<p><font face=""Raleway",sans-serif" color="#636363" size="2">
							Remember to include sufficient image area on all 
							edges where images or color bleed (print over the 
							edge).</font></p>
							<p><font face=""Raleway",sans-serif" color="#636363" size="2"><b>
							SPECIAL COLORS</b>&nbsp;</font></p>
							<p><font face=""Raleway",sans-serif" color="#636363" size="2">We 
							will try to match as closely as possible but be 
							aware that some Pantone, Florescent or Special 
							colors are not exactly achievable by CYMK process.</font></p>

							Timelines &amp; Proofs</b>&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Once your graphics have been received by our 
							Graphics Department, we will start by reviewing your 
							graphic file or files to ensure that your artwork 
							has met the criteria outlined in these 
							specifications to produce the best quality output 
							graphics. If any modifications or changes to the 
							artwork need to be made, you will be notified, and 
							you will have the opportunity to submit new artwork 
							with the necessary changes. If new artwork is not 
							submitted and you choose to have our Graphics 
							Department make the modifications or changes, you 
							will be billed at a rate of $100 per hour.&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							After our Graphics Department has reviewed your 
							artwork, you will receive at least one jpeg (.jpg) 
							proof via email. You will receive these proofs 
							within 24-48 hours of submitting artwork to us. You 
							must respond to this email approving your artwork 
							for print. The faster we get an approval, the faster 
							we can begin the printing process.&nbsp;A proof must 
							be approved within 72 hours. We will start the 
							printing job if we don't hear from you within 3 
							days. To meet any deadline, we reserve the right to 
							start the printing process without any proof sent to 
							you.&nbsp; Any proof approval has to come from an 
							individual/company who places the order. We will NOT 
							communicate with the third party for approvals.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Once your approval has been received, the printing 
							process will take 5-7 days . Please note that these 
							production lead times are from the date of approval, 
							not 
							from the date that the artwork was received. If you 
							have purchased graphics that include a rush charge, 
							then the amount of production days will be less. 
							Please factor in shipping time from when the 
							graphics will be printed when trying to determine 
							when you will receive the final graphics. If you 
							need to rush an order that was not originally 
							purchased with a rush fee, then please contact your 
							sales representative immediately for assistance.</font></p></div>
